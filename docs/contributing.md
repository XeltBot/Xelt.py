## Getting Started

### Design Principles

One of the major factors that led to Xelt's downfall is the fundamental lack of design principles. In order to ensure Xelt success, there must be some design principles that should be put in place. There are as listed:

- **Efficiency**: The efficiency of the code matters. The question that should be thought of when designing a new feature is what is the most efficient way that this algorithm can be done? When it comes to Discord bots, performance is key. Sure, you can use a different programming language like Go or Rust, and have increased performance that way, but another way to increase performance is simply optimizing the code itself.

- **Think before you code**: Programming isn't about just writing some code. Fundamentally, each new feature needs to be first designed, and prototyped before any code can be touched. First, before you start programming, get a sheet of paper out. This could be just any piece of paper, or it could be something like MSPaint. Then, design and think of every single step through. Consider the efficiency and the costs of the design. Then, write out any pseudo code on paper. Prototype a small scale version, which would be a proof of concept. Make sure to test all of the parts first, and test the integration of said parts. Then, once you think you have it set and everything works, then finally program the version that will go on the bot. This thought process is used in many software engineering industries. If you have taken AP CSA, you already know what I mean by this.

- **The end user**: Ultimately you are shipping your own product to your end users. Think about what it would feel like being said user. Would the commands work? Are their any flaws, or any parts that can be improved on? 

- **Testing**: There are unit tests set up for a reason... Unit testing and integration testing are 2 of the major building blocks to the success of any project.
